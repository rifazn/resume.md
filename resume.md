## About Me

I _love_ the open source philosophy! Fortunately, I have been able to contribute both in terms of source code, and activism for open source. I also love _music_, _and_ ___cars___ with great passion. I can talk for days about automobile, although I still don't own one (please help me change that, thank you!)

Most of all, I love learning things as they satisfy my curious and mischievous mind.
I believe that this world is truly _and constantly_ inspiring. Albeit, mixed with some unpleasantries here and there...

## Open Source

### Source Code Contributions

I posted two bug reports in the _'altdesktop/i3ipc-python'_ library and Pull Requests for both of them got accepted.

The _'i3ipc-python'_ is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) library for interacting with _'i3wm'_ and _'swaywm'_ both of which are tiling window managers for the GNU/Linux desktop.

1. The 'SwayWM' version of the library was missing an API that returns all GUI windows belonging to a given app by name: [https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python/issues/170](https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python/issues/170) 
2. The same framework was also missing an API that was part of the SwayWM's IPC specifications, so I implemented it: [https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python/issues/172](https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python/issues/172)

### <span>Mozilla Foundation (Volunteering)</span>

I was one of the core volunteers of the Mozilla Bangladesh team. For my contributions to Mozilla's ultimate mission of the "Open Web", I was flown (free of cost) to _San Francisco, California, USA_, to attend the _Mozilla Summit 2013_.

Towards the end of my volunteership (around 2015), I was the acting leader of our local community's "WebMaker" team. "WebMaker" was a Mozilla project that aimed to make teaching, and learning, how to _make_ things on the _web_ more accessible.

You can read a more about the kinds of activities that I did as a volunteer, along with a few blog posts that cover the different events here:

### Also noteworthy

Full-time Linux user since 2013.

You can view my very portable configuration files to turn your computer just like mine in the link provided below.

## Some of my own projects

### <span>HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 4, Responsive design)</span> <span></span>

A little website that I submitted as a project in _Harvard's CS50 Web Programming course_. The website ranks my top 5 most favorite cars of the world. It is made using _Twitter's Bootstrap 4_ framework for responsiveness.

Video demonstration: [https://youtu.be/PqCECeuPL6Y](https://youtu.be/PqCECeuPL6Y)

### <span>Using Flask(Python) and REST API</span> <span></span>

This is a _Flask app_ that fetches book ratings by communicating with _Goodreads.com_ through their _REST API_. I made this for an online course, _Harvard's CS50 Web Programming_, that I am still completing.

Video demonstration: [https://youtu.be/427Z2yCrviE](https://youtu.be/427Z2yCrviE)

### <span>A simple Django App</span> <span></span>

This is a simple Django app that partially imitates the functionality of Wikipedia.org. Anyone can add, and modify existing pages using Markdown (instead of wikitext). This was also one of the projects required in _Harvard's CS50 Web Programming_ course.
